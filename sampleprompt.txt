First use mcp_figma-mcp_get_design_context and mcp_figma-mcp_get_screenshot to extract the generated code and visual from Figma, 
then use mcp_aem-eds-mcp_generateEdsBlock to handle the complete generation including analysis, validation and section model updates. 

Don't create files manually - use the MCP pipeline.
